# You can be denied operations on a file because of Unix permissions, ACLs, 
# file flags, or SIP. To fully unlock a file:

#sudo chmod -N file        # Remove ACLs from file
#sudo chmod ugo+rw file    # Give everyone read-write permission to file
#sudo chflags nouchg file  # Clear the user immutable flag from file
#sudo chflags norestricted file  # Remove the SIP protection from file

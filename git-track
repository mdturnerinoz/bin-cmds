# At some point, I will make a usable shell function out of this.
#
# Creating a tracking connection is easy. When creating a new local branch that
# is based on an existing remote branch, you simply use the git checkout
# command with the --track flag set, for example:
# 
# git checkout â€”track origin/development
# 
# This command will create a new local branch called "development," which is
# based on "origin/development." It will directly perform a checkout on this
# new local branch and (thanks to the --track option) make sure that a
# tracking relationship is set up properly.
# When you first want to publish your local HEAD branch on a remote, you can
# use the -u flag with the push command:
# 
# git push -u origin development
# 
# This command tells Git to publish our current local HEAD branch on the
# "origin" remote under the name "development." The -u flag makes sure a
# tracking connection is set up.
# 
# If you're curious how this works on a technical level, Git records your
# tracking connections in its .git/config file.
